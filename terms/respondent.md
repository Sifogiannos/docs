You hereby give your consent for the lawful processing of your data by our Clients, with whom we share such data. We require from our clients to abide by the GDRP and/or the EU-US/SWISS-US privacy shield, in relation to their processing of your data.

Such third-party entities, depending on their business scope, may engage in Online Behavioral and Interest based Advertising, allowing advertisers to infer interests and serve ads to users based on their activity and location over time.

In the latter case, US located cloud hosting providers are selected by Pollfish, on grounds of US providers being certified members of the U.S. - EU Privacy Shield companies (https://www.privacyshield.gov/list ).
* We may disclose data collected by us (including Direct Personally Identifiable Data, such as e-mail address etc. which the user sends to Pollfish in order to participate in competitions), if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement activity or other legal process.

We require from all third parties with whom we share your data to agree and warrant that all the processing operations in which they engage shall be lawful and compliant with the provisions of the GDPR (even if not applicable directly by Law to their business) and/or the EU-US/SWISS-US Privacy Shield and any further Data Protection Legislation which may be applicable to their business.
