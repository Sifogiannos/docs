**THIS AGREEMENT**

**PART A [Terms of Service]** of this Publisher Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (this &quot;Agreement&quot;) governs your use of the Pollfish Website and Services as made available to you by Pollfish.

**PART B [Privacy Policy]** of this Agreement discloses the ways we process your personal information, the purposes of processing and your Privacy rights.

**In order to access the Pollfish Website and Service you are requested to accept and conform to this Agreement, otherwise you will not have access to our Services.**

**PART A: TERMS OF SERVICE**

**1. OUR SERVICE- GENERAL**

Pollfish is an on-line survey platform (&quot;The Service&quot;), through which Researchers may conduct surveys. By registering to Pollfish, the researcher has the opportunity to create a questionnaire (or ask Pollfish to create a questionnaire for him) and address the questionnaire to the specific public he targets. Pollfish collaborates with Publishers of applications for smartphones and/or Website owners (collectively hereinafter referred to as Publisher(s) or &quot;you&quot;) in order to have access to users of these applications and websites. By integrating Pollfish SDK/libraries to their platform/websites and thus exposing their users to Pollfish surveys, Publishers gain revenue for each completed survey. Pollfish does not charge Publishers, who decide to integrate Pollfish SDK/libraries in their applications, with any costs.

**1.1 OUR SERVICE: REVENUE GENERATING TYPES OF SURVEYS**

The following type of revenue generating surveys may be conducted on the Pollfish platform:

**(a) Basic Surveys**

When a Basic Survey is conducted, Pollfish pays to the Publishers who register Pollfish in their application/website, a minimum lump sum of approximately $0,30, for each completed survey/questionnaire. This lump sum may change at any time, but any such change shall not apply to running or completed surveys but only to future ones. If the survey/questionnaire is not completed or is not valid for any reason, no revenue will be delivered to the Publisher.

**(b) Playful Surveys**

When a Playful Survey is conducted, the payment of a fee may vary depending on the extent of the research. The minimum lump sum fee described above does not apply in this case. However, the Publisher, when installing Pollfish, may disable the Playful Surveys option and accept to adhere only for Basic Surveys.

**(c) 3rd Party Surveys (Pollfish Mediation)**

When a 3rd Party Survey is conducted through Pollfish Mediation, Pollfish pays to the Publishers who register Pollfish in their application/website, a minimum lump sum of approximately $0,30, for each completed survey/questionnaire. These surveys arrive to Pollfish via partnerships formed with other 3rd Party Survey providers. 3rd Party Surveys have a different look and feel from Pollfish Basic and Playful surveys (they do not follow the Pollfish mobile design) and are launched in an external browser most of the times outside of the context of the app, after an initial prompt. However, the Publisher, when installing Pollfish,., may enable or disable 3rd party surveys from different providers through Pollfish Dashboard without the need for changes in code.

**1.2 OUR SERVICE: NON-REVENUE GENERATING TYPES OF SURVEYS**

The following types of non-revenue generating surveys are also conducted on the Pollfish Platfom:

**(a) Screening process surveys:**

Some surveys require a screening process to detect if a mobile user/website visitor is eligible for taking a survey. If a user fails to pass the screening process then the survey is considered as not completed and no revenue will be delivered to the Publisher.

**(b) Demographic information surveys:**

In order to constantly improve Pollfish platform, and make sure that app users are targeted for surveys that would be relevant to them, when a user is first introduced to the platform a standalone demographic survey will be shown. This survey returns no payment to app Publishers, as it is part of the process users need to go through in order for Pollfish to deduct whether they are eligible for survey tendering. Bear in mind that if a paid survey is available at that point, the demographic questions will be inserted at the beginning of the paying survey, before the actual survey questions. In this process, Publishers have full control, in the sense that Publishers can decide whether their users are served demographic standalone surveys or not in two ways: either in code or through the Pollfish Developer Dashboard. If a Publisher chooses to disable demographic standalone surveys, these surveys will be inserted at the beginning of paid party surveys, when available.

**1.3 OUR SERVICE: PAYMENT TERMS**

(i) Publishers get paid on a monthly base through the payment system and payment channel determined by Pollfish or other agreed method (if such a special agreement is concluded between Pollfish and app-Publisher). Pollfish may use the services of third-party payment systems and solutions (e.g. multi-payment solution hosting entities) in order to effect payments and therefore, Publishers shall be requested to provide their consent, cooperate and abide by the terms and conditions of such third-party entities. If the Publisher declines to accept the rules and terms and conditions of such third-party payment systems, no payment can or shall be able to be effected by Pollfish to the declining Publisher.

(ii) Pollfish, at the request of such third-party entity which shall be responsible to effect payments, may disclose information about you to such third party or may request you to provide all further necessary identifying information about you either to Pollfish or directly to such third-party entity, for purposes of compliance with National, State or Federal laws (e.g. laws concerning foreign asset controls, or other similar procedures prescribed by law). By accepting this Agreement you specifically agree to the above and accept that you shall fully cooperate with Pollfish or such third-party entity, for the reasons stated above.

(iii) Please bear in mind that you (and not Pollfish) are responsible for bearing and paying all requested possible commissions or other transaction costs (banking costs, credit, debit charges etc.), as may be requested by the third-party payment system appointed by Pollfish to effect payments and depending on your preferred payment method. You, the Publisher are also responsible for paying all relevant taxes or fees that may arise from payments and transactions. You acknowledge that all and any aforementioned costs (e.g. commission fees) shall be deducted from the sum payable to you by Pollfish, according to the terms of such third party payment systems (and depending on your preferred method of payment), for which you are so notified when using the relevant third party payment service and/or visiting the account section on the Pollfish Publisher Dashboard.

(iv) Before you start using our Services and calculating your revenues from the use of the Pollfish platform, please check the terms of service of such third-party systems in order to get informed about third party commission rates or other possible costs leading to certain deductions from your final payments. We also note that Publishers may at all times visit their account section on the Pollfish Publisher Dashboard and state their preferred payment method. Costs and fees deducted from their payment, are analytically indicated therein, based on the Publisher&#39;s preferred payment method.

(v) Pollfish, may, from time to time, request from you (the Publisher) to provide information about your app/website, in order for Pollfish to be able to verify compliance of your app with the terms and conditions of this agreement and in order to verify the sincerity of your registered info and actual operation of your registered app/website. In case you fail to deliver the verification-information requested by Pollfish, Pollfish shall have the right to withhold all due payments until the requested verification information is provided by you.

(vi) Payments are made within a two weeks&#39; time frame (Net14), commencing always after the 1st day of each calendar month. For Publishers generating more than $10.000 (&amp;gt;$10k) payments shall be made within a forty-five days&#39; time frame (Net45) commencing always after the 1st day of each calendar month. If the amount to be paid is less than $30, the payment will be withheld and transferred to the next month, until the amount reaches or exceeds the amount of $30.

(vii) Publishers or Networks that use Pollfish with an API integration and not with the standard SDK integration will be paid in Net45. All Referral prices are displayed in USD and may be found in https://www.pollfish.com/referral. Polllfish Inc. is a registered US company. All Publisher payments occur in US currency. Notifications/listeners fired from the SDK within the apps to inform the user about the money to be earned from a survey, are delivered in USD.

(viii) Pricing, timing and methods of payments may change at any time without prior notice. However, such change will not affect the minimum price of ongoing services; it will apply from the next survey. Pollfish seeks long term relationships with app Publishers. Consequently, if you chose to delete or otherwise stop the operation of your registered app/website, you agree and acknowledge that Pollfish shall not proceed to any payment of fees referring to the time period between the last payment you received from Pollfish and the date of deletion of your app/website.

**1.4 OUR SERVICE: USER INCENTIVISATION**

(i) If you decide to set money rewards in order to incentivize your user to complete surveys, please have the following in mind: Calculation of Publisher fees and related payments made by Pollfish to the Publisher, are based on the completed survey reports, as reported to Pollfish through the server-to-server callbacks. However, please note that Pollfish reserves the right not to proceed to payments even if they initially correspond to the number and amount of completed surveys as reported through server-to-server callbacks, at all cases where the monitoring checks of Pollfish detect, retrospectively, misrepresentation in relation to completed surveys, due to system errors or due to fraudulent activity (e.g. false impersonation of user responses).

(ii) Server-to-server callbacks, being the standard industry practice for implementing user-rewarding policies in monetization networks, is also the suggested way to reward your own users in case you decide to do so. Other reports or analytics you may be collecting run the risk of being more vulnerable to user fraud, false code implementation, false counting of analytics and several other errors. Therefore, calculation of due payments owed to your own users, as a result of a money rewarding policy set by you in order to incentivize your app users, should be based on the completed survey reports, as reported by our servers through the secure callbacks. Furthermore, in order to be sure about the integrity and uniqueness of the completed surveys as reported, you should be using all suggested arguments in your callback url. In case you choose not to implement Pollfish&#39;s server-to-server callbacks, please bear in mind that Pollfish shall not proceed to any payments which deviate from server-to-server callbacks reports.

(iii) Pollfish server to server option is available on the Pollfish dashboard and can be used at your convenience. However, Pollfish cannot and does not guarantee that the server-to-server callback system as described above shall be invulnerable from system errors or user fraud. Pollfish accepts no responsibility and cannot be held liable for any loss of money suffered by the Publisher due to reporting faults stemming from system errors or user fraud but shall immediately inform the Publisher about such faults if and when detected by Pollfish&#39;s monitoring checks.

**2. SPECIAL AGREEMENTS**

In certain cases, and for chosen partners (e.g. big scale Publisher entities) Pollfish offers API integration options, under separate commercial agreements concluded between such partners and Pollfish. The present Agreement, however, applies to these agreements unless otherwise agreed between Pollfish and the abovementioned business partners. In such cases, payment to partners shall be made within a 45day time frame (Net45), commencing always after the 1st day of each calendar month.

**3. REFERRAL PROGRAM**

Pollfish has a referral program in place, through which, a Publisher may introduce Pollfish to other Publishers. By using the Pollfish referral system, a Publisher may gain additional earnings as indicated in https://www.pollfish.com/referral. For earnings from referrals the same rules apply as described in Section 1.3 of PART A of this Agreement above.

1. It will have in place procedures so that any third party it authorises to have access to the personal data, including processors, will respect and maintain the confidentiality and security of the personal data. Any person acting under the authority of the data importer, including a data processor, shall be obligated to process the personal data only on instructions from the data importer. This provision does not apply to persons authorised or required by law or regulation to have access to the personal data.

1. It has no reason to believe, at the time of entering into these clauses, in the existence of any local laws that would have a substantial adverse effect on the guarantees provided for under these clauses, and it will inform the data exporter (which will pass such notification on to the authority where required) if it becomes aware of any such laws.

1. It will process the personal data for purposes described in Annex B, and has the legal authority to give the warranties and fulfil the undertakings set out in these clauses.

1. It will identify to the data exporter a contact point within its organisation authorised to respond to enquiries concerning processing of the personal data, and will cooperate in good faith with the data exporter, the data subject and the authority concerning all such enquiries within a reasonable time.

1. At the request of the data exporter, it will provide the data exporter with evidence of financial resources sufficient to fulfil its responsibilities under clause III (which may include insurance coverage).

1. Upon reasonable request of the data exporter, it will submit its data processing facilities, data files and documentation needed for processing to reviewing, auditing and/or certifying by the data exporter (or any independent or impartial inspection agents or auditors, selected by the data exporter and not reasonably objected to by the data importer) to ascertain compliance with the warranties and undertakings in these clauses, with reasonable notice and during regular business hours. The request will be subject to any necessary consent or approval from a regulatory or supervisory authority within the country of the data importer, which consent or approval the data importer will attempt to obtain in a timely fashion.

1. It will process the personal data, at its option, in accordance with:

(i) the data protection laws of the country in which the data exporter is established, or

(ii) the relevant provisions
# 1
 of any Commission decision pursuant to Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC (corresponding Article 45 of the GDPR), where the data importer complies with the relevant provisions of such an authorisation or decision and is based in a country to which such an authorisation or decision pertains, but is not covered by such authorisation or decision for the purposes of the transfer(s) of the personal data
# 2
, or

(iii) the data processing principles set forth in Annex A.

Initials of data importer: Pollfish Inc. ;

1. It will not disclose or transfer the personal data to a third-party data controller located outside the European Economic Area (EEA) unless it notifies the data exporter about the transfer and

1. the third-party data controller processes the personal data in accordance with a Commission decision finding that a third country provides adequate protection, or

(ii) the third-party data controller becomes a signatory to these clauses or another data transfer agreement approved by a competent authority in the EU, or

(iii) data subjects have been given the opportunity to object, after having been informed of the purposes of the transfer, the categories of recipients and the fact that the countries to which data is exported may have different data protection standards, or

(iv) with regard to onward transfers of sensitive data, data subjects have given their unambiguous consent to the onward transfer.

**III. Liability and third party rights**

(a) Each party shall be liable to the other parties for damages it causes by any breach of these clauses. Liability as between the parties is limited to actual damage suffered. Punitive damages (i.e. damages intended to punish a party for its outrageous conduct) are specifically excluded. Each party shall be liable to data subjects for damages it causes by any breach of third-party rights under these clauses. This does not affect the liability of the data exporter under its data protection law.

(b) Each party shall perform its obligations under these clauses at its own cost.

(c) The parties will indemnify each other and hold each other harmless from any cost, charge, damages, expense or loss which they cause each other as a result of their breach of any of the provisions of these clauses. Indemnification hereunder is contingent upon (a) the party(ies) to be indemnified (the &quot;indemnified party(ies)&quot;) promptly notifying the other party(ies) (the &quot;indemnifying party(ies)&quot;) of a claim, (b) the indemnifying party(ies) having sole control of the defence and settlement of any such claim, and (c) the indemnified party(ies) providing reasonable cooperation and assistance to the indemnifying party(ies) in defence of such claim

(d) The parties agree that a data subject shall have the right to enforce as a third party beneficiary this clause and clauses I(b), I(d), I(e), II(a), II(c), II(d), II(e), II(h), II(i), III(a), V, VI(d) and VII against the data importer or the data exporter, for their respective breach of their contractual obligations, with regard to his personal data, and accept jurisdiction for this purpose in the data exporter&#39;s country of establishment. In cases involving allegations of breach by the data importer, the data subject must first request the data exporter to take appropriate action to enforce his rights against the data importer; if the data exporter does not take such action within a reasonable period (which under normal circumstances would be one month), the data subject may then enforce his rights against the data importer directly. A data subject is entitled to proceed directly against a data exporter that has failed to use reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able to satisfy its legal obligations under these clauses (the data exporter shall have the burden to prove that it took reasonable efforts).

**IV. Law applicable to the clauses**

These clauses shall be governed by the law of the country in which the data exporter is established, with the exception of the laws and regulations relating to processing of the personal data by the data importer under clause II(h), which shall apply only if so selected by the data importer under that clause. In the event of a dispute between the data importer and the data exporter concerning any alleged breach of any provision of these clauses, such dispute shall be finally settled under the rules of arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said rules. The place of arbitration shall be New York, US. The number of arbitrators shall be 3.

**V. Resolution of disputes with data subjects or the authority**

1. In the event of a dispute or claim brought by a data subject or the authority concerning the processing of the personal data against either or both of the parties, the parties will inform each other about any such disputes or claims, and will cooperate with a view to settling them amicably in a timely fashion.

1. The parties agree to respond to any generally available non-binding mediation procedure initiated by a data subject or by the authority. If they do participate in the proceedings, the parties may elect to do so remotely (such as by telephone or other electronic means). The parties also agree to consider participating in any other arbitration, mediation or other dispute resolution proceedings developed for data protection disputes.

1. Each party shall abide by a decision of a competent court of the data exporter&#39;s country of establishment or of the authority which is final and against which no further appeal is possible.

**VI. Termination**

1. In the event that the data importer is in breach of its obligations under these clauses, then the data exporter may temporarily suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until the breach is repaired or the contract is terminated.

1. In the event that:

(i) the transfer of personal data to the data importer has been temporarily suspended by the data exporter for longer than one month pursuant to paragraph (a);

1. compliance by the data importer with these clauses would put it in breach of its legal or regulatory obligations in the country of import;

1. the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of any warranties or undertakings given by it under these clauses;

1. a final decision against which no further appeal is possible of a competent court of the data exporter&#39;s country of establishment or of the authority rules that there has been a breach of the clauses by the data importer or the data exporter; or

1. a petition is presented for the administration or winding up of the data importer, whether in its personal or business capacity, which petition is not dismissed within the applicable period for such dismissal under applicable law; a winding up order is made; a receiver is appointed over any of its assets; a trustee in bankruptcy is appointed, if the data importer is an individual; a company voluntary arrangement is commenced by it; or any equivalent event in any jurisdiction occurs

then the data exporter, without prejudice to any other rights which it may have against the data importer, shall be entitled to terminate these clauses, in which case the authority shall be informed where required. In cases covered by (i), (ii), or (iv) above the data importer may also terminate these clauses.

1. Either party may terminate these clauses if (i) any Commission positive adequacy decision under Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC (or any superseding text, i.e. under Article 45 of the GDPR) is issued in relation to the country (or a sector thereof) to which the data is transferred and processed by the data importer, or (ii) Directive 95/46/EC (or any superseding text, i.e. the GDPR) becomes directly applicable in such country.

1. The parties agree that the termination of these clauses at any time, in any circumstances and for whatever reason (except for termination under clause VI(c)) does not exempt them from the obligations and/or conditions under the clauses as regards the processing of the personal data transferred.

**VII. Variation of these clauses**

The parties may not modify these clauses except to update any information in Annex B, in which case they will inform the authority where required. This does not preclude the parties from adding additional commercial clauses where required.

**VIII. Description of the Transfer**

The details of the transfer and of the personal data are specified in Annex B. The parties agree that Annex B may contain confidential business information which they will not disclose to third parties, except as required by law or in response to a competent regulatory or government agency, or as required under clause I(e). The parties may execute additional annexes to cover additional transfers, which will be submitted to the authority where required. Annex B may, in the alternative, be drafted to cover multiple transfers.

**ANNEX A**

**DATA PROCESSING PRINCIPLES**

1. **Purpose limitation:** Personal data may be processed and subsequently used or further communicated only for purposes described in Annex B or subsequently authorised by the data subject.

1. **Data quality and proportionality** : Personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. The personal data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are transferred and further processed.

1. **Transparency:** Data subjects must be provided with information necessary to ensure fair processing (such as information about the purposes of processing and about the transfer), unless such information has already been given by the data exporter.

1. **Security and confidentiality:** Technical and organisational security measures must be taken by the data controller that are appropriate to the risks, such as against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, presented by the processing. Any person acting under the authority of the data controller, including a processor, must not process the data except on instructions from the data controller.

1. **Rights of access, rectification, deletion and objection:** As provided in Article 12 of Directive 95/46/EC (corresponding Article 15 of the GDPR), data subjects must, whether directly or via a third party, be provided with the personal information about them that an organisation holds, except for requests which are manifestly abusive, based on unreasonable intervals or their number or repetitive or systematic nature, or for which access need not be granted under the law of the country of the data exporter. Provided that the authority has given its prior approval, access need also not be granted when doing so would be likely to seriously harm the interests of the data importer or other organisations dealing with the data importer and such interests are not overridden by the interests for fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. The sources of the personal data need not be identified when this is not possible by reasonable efforts, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. Data subjects must be able to have the personal information about them rectified, amended, or deleted where it is inaccurate or processed against these principles. If there are compelling grounds to doubt the legitimacy of the request, the organisation may require further justifications before proceeding to rectification, amendment or deletion. Notification of any rectification, amendment or deletion to third parties to whom the data have been disclosed need not be made when this involves a disproportionate effort. A data subject must also be able to object to the processing of the personal data relating to him if there are compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation. The burden of proof for any refusal rests on the data importer, and the data subject may always challenge a refusal before the authority.

1. **Sensitive data:** The data importer shall take such additional measures (e.g. relating to security) as are necessary to protect such sensitive data in accordance with its obligations under clause II.

1. **Data used for marketing purposes:** Where data are processed for the purposes of direct marketing, effective procedures should exist allowing the data subject at any time to &quot;opt-out&quot; from having his data used for such purposes.

1. **Automated decisions:** For purposes hereof &quot;automated decision&quot; shall mean a decision by the data exporter or the data importer which produces legal effects concerning a data subject or significantly affects a data subject and which is based solely on automated processing of personal data intended to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to him, such as his performance at work, creditworthiness, reliability, conduct, etc. The data importer shall not make any automated decisions concerning data subjects, except when:

1. (i) such decisions are made by the data importer in entering into or performing a contract with the data subject, and

(ii) the data subject is given an opportunity to discuss the results of a relevant automated decision with a representative of the parties making such decision or otherwise to make representations to that parties.

or

1. where otherwise provided by the law of the data exporter.
