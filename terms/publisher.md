**WHAT WE DO**

Pollfish is an on-line survey platform (&quot;The Service&quot;), through which Researchers may conduct surveys. By registering to Pollfish, the researcher has the opportunity to create a questionnaire (or ask Pollfish to create a questionnaire for him based on specific data) and address the questionnaire to the specific public he targets.

By integrating Pollfish SDK/libraries to their platform/websites and thus exposing their users to Pollfish surveys, Publishers gain revenue for each completed survey. Pollfish does not charge Publishers who decide to integrate Pollfish SDK/libraries in their applications with any costs.

**THIS AGREEMENT**

**PART A [Terms of Service]** of this Publisher Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (this &quot;Agreement&quot;) governs your use of the Pollfish Website and Services as made available to you by Pollfish.

**PART B [Privacy Policy]** of this Agreement discloses the ways we process your personal information, the purposes of processing and your Privacy rights.

**In order to access the Pollfish Website and Service you are requested to accept and conform to this Agreement, otherwise you will not have access to our Services.**

**PART A: TERMS OF SERVICE**

**1. OUR SERVICE- GENERAL**

Pollfish is an on-line survey platform (&quot;The Service&quot;), through which Researchers may conduct surveys. By registering to Pollfish, the researcher has the opportunity to create a questionnaire (or ask Pollfish to create a questionnaire for him) and address the questionnaire to the specific public he targets. Pollfish collaborates with Publishers of applications for smartphones and/or Website owners (collectively hereinafter referred to as Publisher(s) or &quot;you&quot;) in order to have access to users of these applications and websites. By integrating Pollfish SDK/libraries to their platform/websites and thus exposing their users to Pollfish surveys, Publishers gain revenue for each completed survey. Pollfish does not charge Publishers, who decide to integrate Pollfish SDK/libraries in their applications, with any costs.

**1.1 OUR SERVICE: REVENUE GENERATING TYPES OF SURVEYS**

The following type of revenue generating surveys may be conducted on the Pollfish platform:

**(a) Basic Surveys**

When a Basic Survey is conducted, Pollfish pays to the Publishers who register Pollfish in their application/website, a minimum lump sum of approximately $0,30, for each completed survey/questionnaire. This lump sum may change at any time, but any such change shall not apply to running or completed surveys but only to future ones. If the survey/questionnaire is not completed or is not valid for any reason, no revenue will be delivered to the Publisher.

**(b) Playful Surveys**

When a Playful Survey is conducted, the payment of a fee may vary depending on the extent of the research. The minimum lump sum fee described above does not apply in this case. However, the Publisher, when installing Pollfish, may disable the Playful Surveys option and accept to adhere only for Basic Surveys.

**(c) 3rd Party Surveys (Pollfish Mediation)**

When a 3rd Party Survey is conducted through Pollfish Mediation, Pollfish pays to the Publishers who register Pollfish in their application/website, a minimum lump sum of approximately $0,30, for each completed survey/questionnaire. These surveys arrive to Pollfish via partnerships formed with other 3rd Party Survey providers. 3rd Party Surveys have a different look and feel from Pollfish Basic and Playful surveys (they do not follow the Pollfish mobile design) and are launched in an external browser most of the times outside of the context of the app, after an initial prompt. However, the Publisher, when installing Pollfish,. may enable or disable 3rd party surveys from different providers through Pollfish Dashboard without the need for changes in code.

**1.2 OUR SERVICE: NON-REVENUE GENERATING TYPES OF SURVEYS**

The following types of non-revenue generating surveys are also conducted on the Pollfish Platfom:

**(a) Screening process surveys:**

Some surveys require a screening process to detect if a mobile user/website visitor is eligible for taking a survey. If a user fails to pass the screening process then the survey is considered as not completed and no revenue will be delivered to the Publisher.

**(b) Demographic information surveys:**

In order to constantly improve Pollfish platform, and make sure that app users are targeted for surveys that would be relevant to them, when a user is first introduced to the platform a standalone demographic survey will be shown. This survey returns no payment to app Publishers, as it is part of the process users need to go through in order for Pollfish to deduct whether they are eligible for survey tendering. Bear in mind that if a paid survey is available at that point, the demographic questions will be inserted at the beginning of the paying survey, before the actual survey questions. In this process, Publishers have full control, in the sense that Publishers can decide whether their users are served demographic standalone surveys or not in two ways: either in code or through the Pollfish Developer Dashboard. If a Publisher chooses to disable demographic standalone surveys, these surveys will be inserted at the beginning of paid party surveys, when available.

**1.3 OUR SERVICE: PAYMENT TERMS**

(i) Publishers get paid on a monthly base through the payment system and payment channel determined by Pollfish or other agreed method (if such a special agreement is concluded between Pollfish and app-Publisher). Pollfish may use the services of third-party payment systems and solutions (e.g. multi-payment solution hosting entities) in order to effect payments and therefore, Publishers shall be requested to provide their consent, cooperate and abide by the terms and conditions of such third-party entities. If the Publisher declines to accept the rules and terms and conditions of such third-party payment systems, no payment can or shall be able to be effected by Pollfish to the declining Publisher.

(ii) Pollfish, at the request of such third-party entity which shall be responsible to effect payments, may disclose information about you to such third party or may request you to provide all further necessary identifying information about you either to Pollfish or directly to such third-party entity, for purposes of compliance with National, State or Federal laws (e.g. laws concerning foreign asset controls, or other similar procedures prescribed by law). By accepting this Agreement you specifically agree to the above and accept that you shall fully cooperate with Pollfish or such third-party entity, for the reasons stated above.

(iii) Please bear in mind that you (and not Pollfish) are responsible for bearing and paying all requested possible commissions or other transaction costs (banking costs, credit, debit charges etc.), as may be requested by the third-party payment system appointed by Pollfish to effect payments and depending on your preferred payment method. You, the Publisher are also responsible for paying all relevant taxes or fees that may arise from payments and transactions. You acknowledge that all and any aforementioned costs (e.g. commission fees) shall be deducted from the sum payable to you by Pollfish, according to the terms of such third party payment systems (and depending on your preferred method of payment), for which you are so notified when using the relevant third party payment service and/or visiting the account section on the Pollfish Publisher Dashboard.

(iv) Before you start using our Services and calculating your revenues from the use of the Pollfish platform, please check the terms of service of such third-party systems in order to get informed about third party commission rates or other possible costs leading to certain deductions from your final payments. We also note that Publishers may at all times visit their account section on the Pollfish Publisher Dashboard and state their preferred payment method. Costs and fees deducted from their payment, are analytically indicated therein, based on the Publisher&#39;s preferred payment method.

(v) Pollfish, may, from time to time, request from you (the Publisher) to provide information about your app/website, in order for Pollfish to be able to verify compliance of your app with the terms and conditions of this agreement and in order to verify the sincerity of your registered info and actual operation of your registered app/website. In case you fail to deliver the verification-information requested by Pollfish, Pollfish shall have the right to withhold all due payments until the requested verification information is provided by you.

(vi) Payments are made within a two weeks&#39; time frame (Net14), commencing always after the 1st day of each calendar month. For Publishers generating more than $10.000 (\&gt;$10k) payments shall be made within a forty-five days&#39; time frame (Net45) commencing always after the 1st day of each calendar month. If the amount to be paid is less than $30, the payment will be withheld and transferred to the next month, until the amount reaches or exceeds the amount of $30.

(vii) Publishers or Networks that use Pollfish with an API integration and not with the standard SDK integration will be paid in Net45. All Referral prices are displayed in USD and may be found in https://www.pollfish.com/referral. Polllfish Inc. is a registered US company. All Publisher payments occur in US currency. Notifications/listeners fired from the SDK within the apps to inform the user about the money to be earned from a survey, are delivered in USD.

(viii) Pricing, timing and methods of payments may change at any time without prior notice. However, such change will not affect the minimum price of ongoing services; it will apply from the next survey. Pollfish seeks long term relationships with app Publishers. Consequently, if you chose to delete or otherwise stop the operation of your registered app/website, you agree and acknowledge that Pollfish shall not proceed to any payment of fees referring to the time period between the last payment you received from Pollfish and the date of deletion of your app/website.

**1.4 OUR SERVICE: USER INCENTIVISATION**

(i) If you decide to set money rewards in order to incentivize your user to complete surveys, please have the following in mind: Calculation of Publisher fees and related payments made by Pollfish to the Publisher, are based on the completed survey reports, as reported to Pollfish through the server-to-server callbacks. However, please note that Pollfish reserves the right not to proceed to payments even if they initially correspond to the number and amount of completed surveys as reported through server-to-server callbacks, at all cases where the monitoring checks of Pollfish detect, retrospectively, misrepresentation in relation to completed surveys, due to system errors or due to fraudulent activity (e.g. false impersonation of user responses).

(ii) Server-to-server callbacks, being the standard industry practice for implementing user-rewarding policies in monetization networks, is also the suggested way to reward your own users in case you decide to do so. Other reports or analytics you may be collecting run the risk of being more vulnerable to user fraud, false code implementation, false counting of analytics and several other errors. Therefore, calculation of due payments owed to your own users, as a result of a money rewarding policy set by you in order to incentivize your app users, should be based on the completed survey reports, as reported by our servers through the secure callbacks. Furthermore, in order to be sure about the integrity and uniqueness of the completed surveys as reported, you should be using all suggested arguments in your callback url. In case you choose not to implement Pollfish&#39;s server-to-server callbacks, please bear in mind that Pollfish shall not proceed to any payments which deviate from server-to-server callbacks reports.

(iii) Pollfish server to server option is available on the Pollfish dashboard and can be used at your convenience. However, Pollfish cannot and does not guarantee that the server-to-server callback system as described above shall be invulnerable from system errors or user fraud. Pollfish accepts no responsibility and cannot be held liable for any loss of money suffered by the Publisher due to reporting faults stemming from system errors or user fraud but shall immediately inform the Publisher about such faults if and when detected by Pollfish&#39;s monitoring checks.

**2. SPECIAL AGREEMENTS**

In certain cases, and for chosen partners (e.g. big scale Publisher entities) Pollfish offers API integration options, under separate commercial agreements concluded between such partners and Pollfish. The present Agreement, however, applies to these agreements unless otherwise agreed between Pollfish and the abovementioned business partners. In such cases, payment to partners shall be made within a 45day time frame (Net45), commencing always after the 1st day of each calendar month.

**3. REFERRAL PROGRAM**

Pollfish has a referral program in place, through which, a Publisher may introduce Pollfish to other Publishers. By using the Pollfish referral system, a Publisher may gain additional earnings as indicated in https://www.pollfish.com/referral. For earnings from referrals the same rules apply as described in Section 1.3 of PART A of this Agreement above. Please also check points 12 and 15 of PART A Section 5 (&quot;Further warranties and obligations&quot;) of this Agreement below concerning misuse of the Service and the Pollfish referral scheme.
